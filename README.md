# RVOT_LVOT_CalssificatoinModel
Source code and pre-trained model to predict RVOT and LVOT origins of VT

We intended to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to automatically analyze features of 12-lead ECGs and accurately predict left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) origins that induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) or premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).

The inputs of model are two R-wave peak points of 12-lead standard ECG data, one for PVC, and one for SR beat. Thus, the AI model proposed in this study can be immediately and effortlessly deployed to EP labs. Cardiologists can give an optimum treatment plan both before and during the CA procedure by using this model to predict the origins. The precise prediction of origins can significantly reduce the CA duration and will reduce the risk of complications. The analysis of one patient will take less than second provided every step of measurement and computation is automatically done by the model and the preprocessing approach.
